										<h1>Project 1 :Designing Customized Online Communication Application and Experiences</h1>
									</header>

									

									<p><strong>Project Description:</strong>
									</br>This project aims to design an online communication application for a target group that need remote interaction via text, audio, video, or other channels.
									</p>
									
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Goals</h2>
									<img src="images/icon.png" alt="" />
									<p>I come from <strong>Darkness Will Arise</strong>. We are going to design Handler, which is a communication tools for deaf and hard-to-hear people so that 
									<br>1. They can use online communication, especially those media is in video and audio form, without any trouble.
									<br>2. They can interact with normal people with their most familiar language (i.e. sign language).
									<br>3. They do not depend on lip-reading.
									<br>With these visions, we hope Handler can help the target audience to have better experience when using online communication tools.
									</p>

									<h2>learning and execution process</h2>
									<h2>Empathize</h2>
									<h4>Brainstorm</h4>
									<img src="images/mind map.jpg" alt="" width="100%" />
									<p>We drew a mind map to identify gaps in the markets and their current difficulties. After the first round discussion, we found that the deaf is lack of support for the current online communication tools, especially those interact via audio and video. Hence, we concluded that the deaf as our target audience. To have a better understanding of the obstacles they encounter when using online communication tools, we did research and a mini-experiment, which acts as deaf by muting all people in the lecture.</p>

									<h2>Interpret</h2>
									<h4>POV</h4>
									<p>In order to understand our target users and their need, Point-Of-View is of utmost signifiance. We created our own persona and carried out a mini-experiment : Our group muted the zoom meeting to act as a deaf and tried to attend the lesson. The result was obvious: We failed to follow the slides shown and lost attention within just 5 minutes.

									<hr><h2>Ideate</h2>
									<p>After we identified the trouble the deaf faced currently, we have set certain goals (listed above in the Goals section) so that they can have a better experience on online communication just like what we are experiencing now.In order to achieve those goals, we have included the following features while some of them were banned:</p>

									<h4>Storyboard</h4>
									<p>Using Handler, we believe that our target audience can improve their online communication experience in 2 perspectives: As a receiver and as a sender. We drew a storyboard to demonstrate the situation, which helps us to understand the complete process of Handler. 
									</br></br>As a receiver:</p>
									<img src="images/storyboard_1.jpg" alt="" width="100%" />
									<p>As a sender:</p>
									<img src="images/storyboard_2.png" alt="" / width="100%" >

									<h2>Prototype</h2>
									<table class="reference">
  									<tbody><tr><video src="video/HCI_Handler_Promo_Vid.mp4"  controls="controls" /></tr></tbody></table>
									<hr class="major" />
									<h2>Personal Reflection</h2>
									 <p> Throughout the entire project 1, 
									</br> - I have a better understanding on design process.
									</br> - I have hand-on experience in drawing a story-board, building a prototype, and designing UI. 
									</br> - I have learned the method and tools to help me draw a storyboard which can introduce the entire problem-and-solve process.
									</br> - I have learned a variety of methods to demonstrate our products and the pros and cons of each method.
									</br> - I start to think of the reason why the UI of the app is designed in that way. ( e.g. why is the button in this color? Is it convenient to have such a function? etc.)
									</br> - The project has strengthened what I have thinking about the design of the UI and put it in our products.</br>
									</br>Apart from the technique area, I have understood the obstacles the deaf and hard-to-hear people encountered in their daily life, especially nowadays many things are conducted online.
									The current online communication tools may not be the most suitable one for them. It may eventually enlarge the digital divide between them and the public.
	  								This project reminds me that we have not yet done our best to help the minority in our society. </p>
